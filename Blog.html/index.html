    <h2>THE JOURNEY</h2>
    <h4>HOW ITS GOING...</h4><br>
    <br>
    <br>
<b><p class="container2">I am someone who likes to craete things with my hands myself,<br>
    so  i really do fantasize being a programmer<br>
       At a point,i wanted to go for computer science in school but i was told <br>
       i won't be able to learn more of tech in school and since then i've been<br>
        wondering how i'll go about it, and then my cousin brought the idea of me joining CLG<br>
         and even though i really don't have time these days cause of work<br>
          I still had to create a space for it and <br>
          i couldn't even resist the urge to join the class.<br>
           Since i joined CLG, i've gained alot more apart from coding, <br>
           i know now that W3schools exist and i need to be on the <br>
           internent more when i have challenges with coding<br>
            Also, i learned that learning this course has to do with determination,<br>
            consistency and of course hardwork cause it can be tasking most times<br>
             sometimes, things won't go as ypu've planned but you really need to keep pushing,<br>
               those are what has helped me push to this point and<br>
                i really hope i go further in this.<br>
                 My colleagues has been really supportive, <br>the tutors appears to be the best and everyone's been improving.
