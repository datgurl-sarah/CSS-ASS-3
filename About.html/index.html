    <a href=""><h1>About</h1></a><br>
    <p> I am an undergraduate of Geology at Federal University Oye Ekiti. </p>
    <p>Hobbies: Playing games, singing, Surfing the internent, Eating, Coding, and watching horror movies.</p>
    <p>After i got admission ito the school was when the pandemic issue began and i came home from school<br>
      and had to continue working with the comapny i was working with before going to school, but the pandemic did not give us<br>
      chance to go out for about four months, so then i got into learning lipgloss production online<br>
      After then the pandemic was over and we resumed back to school.
    <p>Also this year,ASUU went on strike an its tiring<br>
        So my cousin asked if i'll like to learn about tech and i was really interested but didnt know how to go about it so YES! <br>
         He connected with few pwople and i enrolled in<br>
         Code Learn Grow (CLG) which is a Starting Point for aspiring developers. But while i was learning i<br>
           found out taht it was really fun even though its tasking and i aspire to learn more and while coding <br>
             if i have any difficulties, i check on google, W3schools, Youtube, or i ask my tutors or colleagues and they sure do help out.<br>
